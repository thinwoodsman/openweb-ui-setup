----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Get ComfyUI working. Seriously, this is too much trouble to detail here. Just go do it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Open the included workflow (sdxl-basic-image-generation-api.json) and ensure that it works, keeping an eye out for the following:
  - this uses and SDXL base and refiner model, which are assumed to be stored in ComfyUI/models/checkpoints/SDXL/ 
	ComfyUI/models/checkpoints/SDXL/sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors
	ComfyUI/models/checkpoints/SDXL/sd_xl_refiner_1.0.safetensors
  - sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors from https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0/tree/main
  - sd_xl_refiner_1.0.safetensors from https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0/tree/main
  - The nodes in the workflow are all included with ComfyUI, and this workflow is one of their templates. It should just work for Stable Diffusion checkpoints.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Configure open-webui

        - go to Admin Settings -> Images
	- enable Image Genertion
	- set Image Generation Engine to ComfyUI
	- set ComfyUI Base URL to your local ComfyUI URL (e.g. http://localhost:8188)
	- SAVE
	- Upload the workflow file you tested above
	  * Don't worry if it doesn't seem to do anything - you can verify it was added in a terminal, see sqlite-json-notes.txt *
        - Set "Prompt" node (text) to 6
	- Set "Model" node (ckpt_name) to 4
	- Set "Width" node to 5
	- Set "Height" node to 5
	- Set "Steps" node to 10
	- Set "Seed" node to 10
	- SAVE
	- Set "Model" to "SDXL/sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors" or another
          SDXL model you like (e.g. zaxiousXL_v40.safetensors)
	
  Test by asking a model to generate a prompt:
	"Generate a prompt for generating an image of Bazaine, coffee cup in one trembling hand and half-eaten croissant in another, as he realizes the Prussians are interrupting his breakfast."
  Depending on the model, this will generate an image, or a prompt suggestion. If a prompt, edit the response to clean it up, and press the image icon in the response edit toolbox, or whatever it's called. The image icon will also regenerate the image.

TODO:
  * open-webui needs to be told that "seed" is named "noise_seed" in Comfyui.
